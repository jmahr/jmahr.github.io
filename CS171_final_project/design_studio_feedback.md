General Feedback
	we're not really showing anything interesting out of the data. maybe show a bar chart with a x axis for time and how much art is shown from the time period on the y axis. show more analysis. some sort of charts using the data. 

	maybe analyze the color frequencies... but they're all black and white. 

	numbers for the data? year, location.

	maybe taking notes from the iphone photo visualization... by collection/year and being able to hover over and show each painting. 
	sorting features? sort by how much white there is in the picture maybe? try to show patterns in the characteristics of the paintings? 

	need something more interesting about the data. try to imagine why would someone use the website? maybe we can cross compare the italian history  with the date lost

	maybe being able to compare different paintings? 

	maybe we can link the paintings to the wikipedia page about the artist?

	maybe create more numbers/data beyond just the surface level json data to show more complex analysis 

	certain topics are probably more frequent among certain artists or certain cities. maybe make a word cloud using these frequencies? topics per artist would be interesting?

	try to find correlations in the data.

	try to see whether it would crash or not when the visualization would work. 


	the search function would be the most difficult to implement probably as the user doesn't really know what topics to search for. we could autocorrect/dropdown for that.
